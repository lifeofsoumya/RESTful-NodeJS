### RESTful API

REST API is Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface more commonly known as REST API web service.

### Funtionality

In this API, we're using a GET request to retrieve a record, a POST request to create one, a PUT request to update a record, and a DELETE request to delete an existing record.

### No Database

To avoid initial complexity I've used only an array of records instead of using Database.

### Possible Improvements

- Front End Dashboard to Add, Update, Delete & View content
- Integrating Database
